"Subnetwork": "A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network.[1]:1,16 The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. <br>Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields: the network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier. The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.",
